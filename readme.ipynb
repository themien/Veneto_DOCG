    "### A. Italian wine classification <a id='preface'></a>\n",
    "Wine is produced in every region of Italy, which is home to some of the oldest wine-producing areas in the world. Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, with an area of 702,000 hectares under vineyard cultivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1963, the first official Italian system of classification of wines was launched. Since then, several modifications and additions to the legislation have been made. The last modification established four basic wine categories. The categories, from the bottom to the top level, are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Vino da Tavola: generic wines that are made either mostly from one kind of authorized 'international' grape variety or entirely from two or more of them.\n",
    " - Vini IGT: wines produced in a specific territory within Italy. These need following a series of specific and precise regulations on authorized varieties, viticultural and vinification practices, labeling instructions, etc. \n",
    " - Vini DOP: This category includes two sub-categories: \n",
    "   - Vini DOC: DOC wines generally come from smaller regions that are particularly vocated for their climatic and geological characteristics, quality, and originality of local winemaking traditions. \n",
    "   - **Vini DOCG**: In addition to fulfilling the requisites for DOC wines, DOCG wines must pass stricter analyses prior to commercialization. They must also demonstrate a superior commercial success. \n",
    "   \n",
    "DOCG wines are the top level wines produced in Italy, therefore the areas where they are produced are generally popular touristic destinations."

Bound on the west by Lake Garda, on the north by the Dolomite Mountains and on the east by the Adriatic Sea, the landscape of the Veneto is rich and varied. From the grandeur of crumbly old Venice to the medieval flavor of Bassano del Grappa, and on to Belluno, a striking town that's a gateway for visiting the Dolomites, the Veneto makes a fascinating region to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Veneto is one of the leading Italian regions in terms of quantity and quality production of grapes. The wines produced in this region are famous throughout the world: Prosecco, Amarone, Recioto, Soave, Valpolicella and Bardolino, are only a few of the names of wines known at international level.\n",

The main user-defined \"ingredients\" of the *k-means* algorithm are the distance function (often Euclidean distance) and the number of clusters *k*. This parameter needs to be set according to the application or problem domain.\n",
