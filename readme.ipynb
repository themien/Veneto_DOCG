    "Wine is produced in every region of Italy, which is home to some of the oldest wine-producing areas in the world. Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, with an area of 702,000 hectares under vineyard cultivation, and contributing a annual average of 48.3 million hl of wine.\n",

    "In 1963, the first official Italian system of classification of wines was launched. Since then, several modifications and additions to the legislation have been made. The last modification established four basic wine categories. The categories, from the bottom to the top level, are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Vino da Tavola (Table Wines): generic wines that are made either mostly from one kind of authorized 'international' grape variety or entirely from two or more of them.\n",
    " - Vini IGT (Wines with Protected Geographical Indication): wines produced in a specific territory within Italy. These need following a series of specific and precise regulations on authorized varieties, viticultural and vinification practices, labeling instructions, etc. \n",
    " - Vini DOP (Wines with Protected Designation of Origin): This category includes two sub-categories: \n",
    "   - Vini DOC (Controlled Designation of Origin). DOC wines generally come from smaller regions that are particularly vocated for their climatic and geological characteristics, quality, and originality of local winemaking traditions. \n",
    "   - Vini DOCG (Controlled and Guaranteed Designation of Origin): In addition to fulfilling the requisites for DOC wines, DOCG wines must pass stricter analyses prior to commercialization. They must also demonstrate a superior commercial success. "

Bound on the west by Lake Garda, on the north by the Dolomite Mountains and on the east by the Adriatic Sea, the landscape of the Veneto is rich and varied. From the grandeur of crumbly old Venice to the medieval flavor of Bassano del Grappa, and on to Belluno, a striking town that's a gateway for visiting the Dolomites, the Veneto makes a fascinating region to explore.\n",
